# Final project proposal

- Examing Occurances of Extreme Temperatures in California Between 1989-2018
- This project will explore temperature observations for the past 30 years in selected counties in Calfornia. It will look at temperature data collected at stations, with observations taken from 1989-12018. This project will examine this data to see if there has been an increase in number of days towns experienced extreme temperatures, which will be classified as days with temperatures above 104 degrees F. It will also look at where these stations are located in California, along with a linear regression to see the effect variables, such as location and year the data was recorded, have on the temperature. All of the stations that are collecting this data are located in top agricultural producing counties in California. Agriculture production begins to decrease when temperatures cross a threshold relative to the specific crop being grown.  Though temperature and its relationship to agriculture will not be examined in this project, the issue of rising temperatures and its dramatic impact on the production of agricultural products was the inspiring question for examining this temperature data. I am unsure if there have been noticable changes in occurances of extreme temperatures in California and want to explore this question.

- The data I will be using is temperature data sourced from NOAA website. I requested specific station data, selecting stations located in top agricultural producing counties of California. I downloaded the data and have included it in a folder named CSV data files in my repository.  
- 3 questions / analysis tasks you will perform on the data; in the spirit of the assignments we have been doing.
My first objective will be to see if there has been an observed increase in number of days that temperatures have exceeded 104 degrees F in towns across California. It will examine this in a few different ways with graphs. The second question will see if there is a visble relationship between the location of the stations and instances of extreme temperature, meaning that It will show if some agricultural regions of california are hotter on average than other locations. The third question will be to looking to see if there are significant factors in the dataset that effect temperature, and to what extent they are significant using a linear regression. Though our course did not specifically address linear regression analysis I thought it was an important skill to have, so I decided to learn how to do this method of analysis in R.

I worked independently on this project and am satisfied with the skills that I leared in this class. I know it is not the most impressive project, but I didnt know how to code in R before this class and am very satisfied with the skills I gained from this course. It was enjoyable and I have a decent foundation to continue building my R skillset on.

## Project Guidelines

### Project questions must illustrate all of the following tasks:

- Some form of data access / reading into R
- Data tidying preparation
- Initial data visualization
- Use of GitHub
- Reproducible execution with use of Travis
- RMarkdown writeup, with final submission as a nicely formatted PDF document that includes code and results.
- Overall clean and clear presentation of repository, code, and explanations.

### and at least three of the following skills (this list may be modified/extended):

- Use of at least 5 `dplyr` verbs / functions
- Writing / working with custom R functions
- Creating an R package for functions used in the analysis
- Interaction with an API
- Use of regular expressions
- Use of an external relational database
- Preparing processed data for archiving / publication
- Parsing extensible data formats (JSON, XML)
- Use of spatial vector data (`sf` package) and visualization of spatial data
- Creation of an R package
- Expansion of ggplot functions (to include more than default characteristics)
- Making layout and presentation into secondary output (e.g. .pdf, website) - should enhance presentaiton
- use lintr to clean code (checks adherence to a given style, syntax errors and possible semantic issues)
